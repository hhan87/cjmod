# cjmod

`cjmod` is a utility designed to help you easily change the permissions of all files and directories within a specified directory recursively on UNIX systems.

## Usage

### 1. Changing File Permissions Recursively

With `cjmod`, you can recursively change the permissions of all files and subdirectories within a specified directory. This is particularly useful for ensuring consistent file permissions or adjusting permissions for deployment environments.

To use `cjmod`, run the following command:

```bash
$ lein run <target-dir> <permission: e.g. "rwxrw-rw-">
<target-dir>: The directory path where you want to change the permissions.
<permission>: The permission string you want to apply (e.g., "rwxrw-rw-").
Make sure you have Leiningen installed and run this command from the projectâ€™s root directory.
```
